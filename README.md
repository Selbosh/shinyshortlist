Before running the Shiny app, make sure to add all your candidate names to the `candidate_names.txt` file - one per line.

You will also need an (empty) `responses/` folder to store the outputs.

If adapting this to a different job role, please also edit the file `criteria.csv` with the descriptions (and number) of essential job criteria.

Probably, I will add more functionality to this at some point in the future (but don't count on it). No warranty is provided.
