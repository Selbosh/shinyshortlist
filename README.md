Before running the Shiny app, make sure to add all your candidate names to the candidate_names.txt file - one per line.

If adapting this to a different job role, please also edit the file criteria.csv with the descriptions (and number) of essential job criteria.

Probably, I will add more functionality to this at some point in the future (but don't count on it). No warranty is provided.
